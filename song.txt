I am a little bit of loneliness, a little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints, but I can help the fact, that everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want, what I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you, to just believe this is real
So I let go, watching you, turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I got
